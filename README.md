# RT-DETR: Real-Time Object Detection Transformer

**Real-Time Object Detection using Transformer-based Architecture**

This project implements **RT-DETR**, an end-to-end **NMS-free object detection model** using PyTorch. It achieves better accuracy and real-time inference speed. The repository includes the improved base model, training scripts, inference tools, and a detailed blog post explaining the model and improvements.
